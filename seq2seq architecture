In this method, for a given text, we create a vector consisting of entries equal to the positions of occurance of the word from a vector 
having all the words recorded in that vector.

Each vector representation would consist of a SOS (Start of sentence) and EOS (End of sentence) along with the word position entries.

Figuratively we only use the EOS , as only after encountering it will the model try to give the most relevant answer.
