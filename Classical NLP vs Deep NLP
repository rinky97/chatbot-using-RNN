We understand that there are two methods of processing natural language, 
1. Classical approach
2. Deep learning approach using a Recurrant Neural Network(RNN)

CLASSICAL APPROACH
 >> if/else questions (every question has a predefined answer)
 >> Audio frequency component analysis (predifined set of frequencies provide information to all the questions asked)
 
 DNLP
 >> In this approach the neural network is trained in such a way that it is capable of finding out the answers to the questions that aren't hardcoded, it self learns.
