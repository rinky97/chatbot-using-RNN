Recurrent Neural Networks works on the principal on how the short term memory of the human brain works.
It remembers the information about the tasks or events done in the recent history and can predict what is going to be the answer to the next.

There are four types of RNN
1. One to one
2. One to many
3. Many to one
4. Many to many

In the case of implementing a chatbot we use Many to many approach since each question is composed to various words and each word is fed 
as an input to a node of the neural network.
